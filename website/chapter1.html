<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>What is Python?</h2>

<p>
<h3 class="gn">Python is a popular programming language.
 It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br>
It is used for:<br>
    1.web development (server-side)<br>
    2.software development<br>
    3.mathematics<br>
    4.system scripting<br>
</h3>
</p>

<h2>What can Python do?</h2>
<p>
<h3 class="gn">Python can be used on a server to create web applications.<br>
    Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.<br>
    Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.<br>
    Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.<br>
    Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.<br>
</h3>
</p>

<h2>Why Python?</h2>
<p>
<h3 class="gn">Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).<br>
    Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br>
    Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.<br>
    Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br>
    Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.<br>
</h3>
</p>

<h2>Good to know</h2>
  <p>
<h3 class="gn">
 1. The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.<br>
 2.However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.<br>
 3. In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor.<br>
4. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.<br>
</h3>
</p>

<h2>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h2>
<p>
<h3 class="gn">
 1. Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.<br>
 2.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.<br>
 3.Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.<br>
